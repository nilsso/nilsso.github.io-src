  class="badge badge-primary">Factory Key</a> This should never leave your
  secure container. On factory it opens two additional extracts ([Gate 0](#),
  [Cellars](#)) and allows you to open the locked room in third floor offices which
  has a possible weapon spawn, two coats, loose loot and occasional high end
  ammo. Where this key can be found: Customs 3-Story dorm guard station;
  Customs glass warehouse in the blue locker; Customs glass warehouse on the
  couch next to the dead scav; Customs checkpoint car trunk, possibly in jacket
  therein; in scav backpacks.
- <a href="#" class="badge badge-info">Key (pumping station)</a> Opens the
  "closed bunker" near machinery in the exit area but only the door nearest
  extract. There is rarely anything worth picking up in here but it can be a
  good ambush position. This key spawns in the locker room on the bench against
  the wall close to the entrance. 
- <a href="#" class="badge badge-secondary">Key (admin)</a> Opens the "closed
  bunker" near machinery in the exit area. There is rarely anything worth
  picking up in here but it can be a good ambush position. This is a random
  drop now.
